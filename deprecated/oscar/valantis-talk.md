### Valantis talk

# Valantis

- Hyperliquid build up, started with purps, options etc grow from there
- Hyperliquid wants and has all necessary feats for users, where do we build from there to utilise the chain in our own application?..
- Chain with two different environments that compliment eachother 1. Hypercore and 2. HyperEVM

- Valntis itself:
1: Liquid staking token called SThype
2: Stakeexhange (launched on chain)

- ITSELF = more liquid staking, briding gaps between coins for users, essentially a building block, how can we build said block into said application?...
- Centred around lending, amounts that can = other amounts around lending - Valantis enable this - look into thier lending and staking mantra to check this
- Stakehype, not just run arund monetary value but the value with holding coins around hype etc
- Valatis labs github = all source code for each layer
- Looking for bounties:
1. New kind of Anm only possible on hyperliquid
2. look into hyperliquid docs
- 'on chain hedgefund'
- "dont need to cover everything given, wants to see all submissions around integrating valantis
